    <p>I believe the lack of schooling is the worst problem Africa is facing. Lack of schooling is preventing children living in Africa from learning to read or write, leading to more problems such as job shortages.

In Africa, 72 million children are not attending school. They are too busy working at home to be able to go to school.  Other reasons children are deprived of education are gender issues, religion, war and health. Different religions are driving children into different schools, so if the religion practiced in a school is different from the child’s religion, the child couldn't go to that school. Wars are destroying schools and sick children are being deprived of school.

Some children that do attend school don't receive a good education. In fact, 37 million children receive extremely poor education. Also, 40 percent of children in fifth and sixth grade don't receive nearly the proper amount of education in Africa.

I believe America could help Africa with this drastic problem. If America could raise enough money, we could build more schools for children to go to. I believe schools throughout all the 50 states in America should donate money by doing some sort of fundraiser.   But not just schools could help, businesses, companies, anyone who is willing to help could raise money for Africa. With many people from America contributing, Africa might have a chance at a proper education.

I hope that you will take these suggestions to heart so we can attempt to make the future of Africa a wonderful future.

    <p>ACCRA, Ghana — The future success of the African continent lies to a large degree in its ability to hone the skills and talents of its ever-growing youth population. However, some argue that the current education system in Africa uses outdated methods and is not preparing children for the future.

“Quality education still remains an illusion to many of Africa’s youth,” said Matthew Opoku Prempeh, Ghanaian minister of education, during the Accra edition of the World Innovation Summit for Education earlier this month.

Access and quality of education must go hand in hand, the minister stated, noting that an estimated 90 million African children are currently out of school.

“Quality without access will lead to inequality and exclusion; access without quality will limit the potential and would not bring [about] the desired results,” Prempeh said.

Experts at the summit acknowledged that the rise of automation and technological advancements require an updated skill set.

Stavros Yiannouka, chief executive officer at WISE, argued that “we cannot continue along the same path — the traditional industrial model of education.”

“If you look at the current education system that we have it’s essentially a standardized batch process … in terms of cohorts, years, process, standardized curriculum,” he said. “How do we break the barriers of conservatism that exist in the education space so that we can make proven solutions accessible to more people?”

Under the theme of the summit — “Unlocking the World's Potential: Leading and Innovating for Quality Education in Africa” — experts discussed ways in which innovative approaches to learning could improve outcomes.

“We need to make lifelong learning a reality, make it successive, because people learn at different paces … We need to give an opportunity to those who are potentially left behind,” Yiannouka said.

An estimated 10 million graduates enter the African workforce each year. By 2040, the continent’s labor force is expected to surpass that of India and China. As a result, Prempeh said that quality education is a central element in building an “Africa beyond aid” and lies at the backbone of its development and enduring prosperity. Quality education also has a multiplier effect on achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, he added.

Following the day’s discussions, here are five key ideas that emerged on how to innovate education in Africa.
